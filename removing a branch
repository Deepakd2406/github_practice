Here’s how to remove (delete) a Git branch — both locally and on remote (GitHub) 👇

🧹 Delete a Local Branch
✅ Safe delete (recommended)

Deletes only if branch is merged:

git branch -d branch_name

❌ Force delete (even if not merged)
git branch -D branch_name

🌐 Delete a Remote Branch (GitHub)
git push origin --delete branch_name


OR (older syntax)

git push origin :branch_name

🔍 Check Branches Before Deleting
List local branches
git branch

List remote branches
git branch -r

⚠️ Important Notes

You cannot delete the branch you are currently on

Switch to another branch first:

git checkout main


(or)

git switch main

🧪 Common Example
git switch main
git branch -d feature-login
git push origin --delete feature-login
